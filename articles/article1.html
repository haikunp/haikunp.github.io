                <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the currency, making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.
                </p>

                <h2>How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is added, it cannot be altered, ensuring transparency and security. This immutability makes blockchain a trusted system for recording financial transactions, supply chain data, and more.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Use Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower Transaction Fees:</strong> Compared to traditional banking systems, cryptocurrency transactions often have lower fees, especially for cross-border payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faster Payments:</strong> Transactions can be processed in minutes, regardless of the geographical location of the parties involved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Privacy:</strong> Cryptocurrencies provide a higher level of anonymity compared to traditional financial systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Inclusion:</strong> Cryptocurrencies enable people without access to traditional banking systems to participate in the global economy.</li>
                </ul>
